# Gas Calculations

> TODO: clean up this section

Gas costs are calculated using methods provided by the `cairo_lang_sierra_gas` crate.

## Findings

- The entry point gas cost is spent from the available gas before executing, but it is also spent when the entry point is called.
- Functions (not libfuncs) generated by corelib don't use gas, even if the calculation from the crate results in a positive gas cost.
